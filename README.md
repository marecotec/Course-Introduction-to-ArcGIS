# Intro-ArcGIS
Geographical information systems (GIS) have become a widely used part of the scientific software field. Some employers value GIS as part a core key skill set in their applicants, and many scientists would benefit from being able to conduct simple analysis and data visualisation for research and publication. In this course, we will be covering an introduction to the ArcGIS software, with worksheets, video tutorials and example assignments.

This course was taught by me at Bangor University for the Marine Environmental Protection Masters Class. I have designed this so we can work through the various areas using the worksheets, and this site acts to consolidate those concepts and provide additional walk-through tuition for students who want to refresh their knowledge, or enhance it through practice.

In total this course should take you around 4-6 hours to complete if you undertake all of the sessions and suggested further practice.
